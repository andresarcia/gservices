The following are examples of gservices.

Client and Server for local communication.

localServer.C
localServer2.C (includes threads)

Client and Server for remote communication using syncronous protocol.
remoteClient.C
remoteServer.C

Client and Server for remote communication using asynchronous protocol.
remoteClient2.C
remoteServer2.C

Client and Server for remote communication using asynchronous protocol,
and forwarding the request to another process.
remoteFwClient.C
remoteFwServer.C

The simplest Client and Server models for remote communication using 
synchronous communication.
simpleRemClient.C
simpleRemServer.C


In order to compile these examples remember to check the following:
1) Have nana library compiled and installed. 
   remeber to configure like this:

   $./configure --enable-rdtsc

   so that you can include time profiling functions.

   Also you have to modify these two archives:
   /usr/local/include/nana-config.h

   in line 80 change 

   #define ALWAYS_INCLUDE_MALLOC/* no arguments */ 1

   by 

   #define ALWAYS_INCLUDE_MALLOC/* no arguments */ 0 

   There is another syntactic error in 

   /usr/local/include/cycles.h

   in line 101 change

   #ifdef _cplusplus

   by

   #ifdef __cplusplus //note the extra underscore "_"

2) Compile and install the Aleph Library (including the IPC system).
